# libreveal.js

Reveals third-party JavaScript libraries in use.

Developed as a hacking tool. You should know what libraries are in use for your own apps, probably.

## Usage

Execute the contents of [**libreveal.min.js**](https://github.com/gingeleski/libreveal.js/blob/master/libreveal.min.js) on your target page via the developer tools console.

See the unminified [**libreveal.js**](https://github.com/gingeleski/libreveal.js/blob/master/libreveal.js) script if you're curious how this works and/or what checks are run.

## Support libraries

Currently (v1.0) this will detect...

- jQuery
- Angular
- Bootstrap

## Credit

Derived in part from [**retire.js**](https://github.com/retirejs/retire.js/) identifiers - this stands on the shoulders of that project.
